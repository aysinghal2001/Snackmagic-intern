Stash

Most recent stash id is 0, then followed by 1,2,3 etc
git stash drop 2- Delete stash with id 2
git stash pop 1 - Apply the stash and delete it from list

Reset

git reset Head <filename> - Unstage the file from the index
git checkout -- <filename> - Reset the file to the last commit

Diff between Git revert and reset

The “git revert” command is slightly different from the “git reset” command because it will record a new commit with the changes introducted by reverting the last commit.

Note also that with “git reset” you specified “HEAD~1” because the reset command sets a new HEAD position while reverting actually reverts the commit specified.

As a consequence, you will have to commit the changes again for the files to be reverted and for the commit to be undone.

git reset HEAD --: unstage all the changes

Merge vs rebase

Rebase shows all commits explicitly
RUBY


puts-> print text and a new line also
print- just print the text in the same line
Methods of string

1. strip()- remove trailing spaces
2. <variable name>.include? "<whatever needs to be searched"
3. to convert an int variable to string

Eg. num=20
puts ("my fav num is" + num.to_s)
ceil and floor- ceil gives higher value and floor give lower value in rounding off
