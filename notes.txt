Diff between Git revert and reset

The “git revert” command is slightly different from the “git reset” command because it will record a new commit with the changes introducted by reverting the last commit.

Note also that with “git reset” you specified “HEAD~1” because the reset command sets a new HEAD position while reverting actually reverts the commit specified.

As a consequence, you will have to commit the changes again for the files to be reverted and for the commit to be undone.

git reset HEAD --: unstage all the changes
